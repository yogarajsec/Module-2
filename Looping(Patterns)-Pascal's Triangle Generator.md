# ðŸ”º Looping(Patterns)-Pascal's Triangle Generator in Python

This project demonstrates a simple Python program to generate **Pascalâ€™s Triangle**, where the number of rows is provided by the user.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim

To write a Python program that generates **Pascal's Triangle** using numbers. The number of rows is accepted from the user.

---

## ðŸ§  Algorithm

1. Start the program.
2. Input the number of rows from the user.
3. Loop from 0 to the number of rows.
4. For each row:
   - Print appropriate spaces to shape the triangle.
   - Compute values using the formula:  
     \[
     C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
     \]
5. Print all rows of Pascalâ€™s Triangle.
6. End the program.

## ðŸ§ª Program
---
rows = int(input())
x = 1
for i in range(1, rows+1):
    for space in range(1, rows-i+1):
        print(" ",end="")
    for j in range(0, i):
        if j==0 or i==0:
            x = 1
        else:
            x *= (i - j)//j
        print(x, end = " ")
    print()

## Sample Output
![438596196-8f276fae-bc4a-4859-ae50-33e3507dc395](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/353fd928-06f4-4294-a9c1-cc7bcd7f5b47)

## Result

Thus,the Python program that generates Pascal's Triangle using numbers. The number of rows is accepted from the user is created successfully.
